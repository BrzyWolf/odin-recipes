        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These flavorful beef and chorizo burgers are topped with caramelized onions, a smoky red pepper and ranch sauce, and shavings of Manchego cheese atop sweet brioche buns.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Burger Meat</li>
            <li>Carmelized Onions</li>
            <li>Ranch Sauce</li>
            <li>Machego Cheese</li>
            <li>Brioche Buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>  Start the burgers: Mix ground sirloin and chorizo together with your hands in a large bowl until well combined. Set aside to let the flavors blend while you cook the onions and make the sauce.</li>

        <li>Cook the onions: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, brown sugar, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until onions are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>At the same time, make the sauce: Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saut√© until tender. Transfer onion to a blender. Add ranch dressing, red pepper, paprika, and saffron; pulse until fairly smooth. Refrigerate until needed.</li>

        <li>Finish the burgers: Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Form meat mixture into four patties, slightly larger than the buns.</li>

        <li>>Cook burgers on the preheated grill until well done, about 5 minutes per side. Split buns in half and spread butter on the insides. Toast briefly on the grill.</li

        <li>>Place burgers onto buns and top with caramelized onions, ranch sauce, and Manchego cheese.</li
    </ol>
